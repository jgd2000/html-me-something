<p> I would like to be one of those guys who say, "I always wanted to be a teacher."; or someone who said," I always knew
    I wanted to be a doctor".  I can even envy someone who says, " I always knew I was going to be an SOB."  That, to me shows
    a certain amount amount of self-knowledge.  These are people who KNEW what they were at a very early age.  They had this
    advantage over the rest of us because they knew exactly how much effort to put into various activities to assure themselves of
    a successful career that would provide for their family and, hopefully, any extras they may discover that they couldn't live
     without.

    When you DON'T know what you are ; when your schools don't care how you turn out even if you are in the Honor Society and Top Ten
    Percent of your class.  (Yes, I'm talking about a top-notch, 90% "White" high school in a major city of Texas.)  If no one tells you, " Son, you could be a first-class teacher/doctor/SOB", you end up
    with a story like mine.

    I was born poor and Hispanic.  Strike one. Strike two.

    Now, the pitcher is rearing back with the ball clenched in his sweaty fist and uncoiling to release it in my direction.
    So, first things first.

    We needed money and fast.  I'm not talking some extra walking-around money.  I mean shoes-buying, coat-buying money.  So, of course,
    I worked.  There are not many people that will hire a 9 or 10 year old kid, but farmers can and do.  I found myself in the outskirts
    of the city picking cotton one summer, picking onions another.  For several summers, I mowed lawns up and down my neighborhood.  I had
    no edger, but I had a long-handled hoe.  Given enough determined whacks with that hoe, those lawns managed to look trimmed.  During
    these jobs I would look around me at the sun-parched West Texas landscape and think how nice it would be to work indoors.

   <figcaption>OK. It wasn't quite this desolate, but you get the idea.  We're talking 100+ degrees in the shade if you can find it.</figcaption>

    "Be careful what you wish for."  At 15 I landed my first "indoor" job.  I was the busser/sweeper/mopper/dishwasher/food preparer
    working in the back (as in "we don't need to air-condition the kitchen") of a restaurant. It sounds made up, but I was making 50 cents
    an hour for 49 hours of work on my feet per week.  This is not 1930's Depression-era dollars and cents.  This is the late 1960's and the
    only depression was my own when I stared down at my weekly pay.

   <figcaption>"Yes, I got paid weakly, I mean weekly.  No, I was right"</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This could take a l-o-n-g time to put down.  So, at this point I will just list a few of the jobs I had since I was 15:
<ol>
    <li>Warehousing</li>
    <li>Cashier/stocker/nightly cleanup in a grocery store</li>
    <li>Sewing and Press Machine Operator in a pants factory</li>
    <li>Smelting copper (got the scars to prove it)</li>
    <li>Substitute teacher(fortunately, no scarring here!)</li>
    <li>Librarian (you actually need a Master's degree from an accredited college (!))</li>
    <li>Taught Business Math and Basic Programming at a community college</li>
    <li>Programmed in Cobol, FORTRAN and C</li>
</ol>

    In summary, while my job resume looks like I had Attention Deficit Disorder, I plead extenuating circumstances.  I was and continue to be addicted to regular meals
    and a roof over my head.  Would I have had a better life with some guidance and advice?  I don't know that I could have followed any other life path.  I actually
    consider myself lucky to have come out "a-head".  Speaking of which...
